The game we created was a 2d Platformer that is set in a more cyberpunk setting, we have deciced on the name WildMan. While we got a lot of work on it its still in early development
and needs much more work to be even better than it is now. Currently with 2 missions to play in this platofroming game your goal is simple reach the end of the 2nd level.
